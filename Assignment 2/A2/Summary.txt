Assignment 2 Summary 

For my test I ran each file 3 times to get an average time, the following are the results:


Accounts 	Sorted Array	Hash Table

20 		3412ms		1481ms

200 		3369ms		1505ms

2,000		4057ms		1691ms

20,000		7541ms		1362ms


	In every case the Sorted Array is slower. The hash table is over twice as fast in every case
and the gap is only increasing as the number of accounts grow. I expected them to have similar
speeds because the Sorted Array is using binary search. I thought this would keep up with the 
hash technique. They also both have to go through each element linearly to resize so no advantage
there. The Sorted Array seems to be taking an expentially longer time as the number of accounts
increase so I predict that with a database of 2 million accounts the Sorted Array would take around
10 times as long as the Hash Table which seems to be pretty consistent as database size increases.

So with a larger database the Hash Table becomes significantly faster.
